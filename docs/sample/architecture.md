# Azure AI RAG Architecture Overview

This document provides an architectural overview of the Azure AI RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system.

## System Components

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline

The document processing pipeline handles the ingestion and preparation of documents for the RAG system:

- **Document Ingestion**: Supports multiple file formats (TXT, MD, PDF, HTML)
- **Text Chunking**: Splits documents into overlapping chunks for optimal retrieval
- **Embedding Generation**: Uses Azure OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 model
- **Vector Indexing**: Stores embeddings in Azure AI Search

### 2. Retrieval System

The retrieval system finds relevant information to answer user queries:

- **Query Embedding**: Converts user questions to vector embeddings
- **Semantic Search**: Uses vector similarity to find relevant document chunks
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines keyword and semantic search for better results
- **Result Ranking**: Ranks results by relevance score

### 3. Generation System

The generation system creates responses using retrieved context:

- **Context Assembly**: Combines retrieved documents into context
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafts prompts with context and user questions
- **Response Generation**: Uses Azure OpenAI GPT models
- **Source Attribution**: Provides references to source documents

## Data Flow

1. **Document Upload**: Documents are uploaded to Azure Storage
2. **Processing**: Documents are chunked and embedded
3. **Indexing**: Embeddings are stored in Azure AI Search
4. **Query Processing**: User questions are converted to embeddings
5. **Retrieval**: Relevant chunks are retrieved from the index
6. **Generation**: GPT generates responses using retrieved context
7. **Response**: Final answer with source citations is returned

## Security Considerations

- All API keys stored in Azure Key Vault
- RBAC controls access to resources
- Network security groups control traffic
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging through Application Insights

## Scalability

The system is designed to scale horizontally:

- Azure AI Search supports multiple replicas and partitions
- Azure OpenAI provides elastic scaling
- Storage accounts can handle large document volumes
- Application can be deployed to multiple regions
